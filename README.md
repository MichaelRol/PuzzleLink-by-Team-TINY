# PuzzleLink by Team TINY
Repository to store Team TINY's software and design files for the PuzzleLink interactive device created for the University of Bristol Masters course COMSM0009, Interactive Devices.

## Overview

Despite a large number of tools and devices being available for carious ways of helping those with autism, there is a distinct lack of option on devices for physical interventions. Our aim was to provide a simple, portable and low-sensory option for use in scenarios ranging from therapy to entertainment. 

PuzzleLink provides simple, intuitive interaction pattern for intended users - autistic children - to easily engage with. Capacitive buttons light up in a compact puzzle shape with a transparent acrylic lid and wirelessly activate a different piece on touch. The pieces are light, durable can be put together in any order or separated and attached to surfaces with the built-in suction cups for more physical movement during the game. 

When connected together the puzzle pieces are designed to help calm the child when in an overstimulating environment by allowing them to focus on a simple repetitive task. When the pieces are separated the device is meant to help the children engage in physical activity.
